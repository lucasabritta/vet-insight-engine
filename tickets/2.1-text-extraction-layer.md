# Ticket 2.1: Text Extraction Layer

**Phase:** 2 - Core Processing Logic

**Description:**
Implement a flexible text extraction layer that handles multiple document formats and supports OCR capabilities.

## Requirements

- [ ] Integrate PyMuPDF for PDF text extraction
- [ ] Integrate python-docx for Word document processing
- [ ] Integrate Tesseract or EasyOCR for image OCR capabilities
- [ ] Implement a strategy pattern to handle different MIME types
- [ ] Create abstraction layer for document parsing
- [ ] Add error handling for unsupported or corrupted files
- [ ] Write unit tests for each extraction strategy
- [ ] Test extraction accuracy with various document types
- [ ] Test error handling for corrupted or unsupported files

## Acceptance Criteria

- Text extraction works correctly for PDF files
- Text extraction works correctly for Word documents (.docx)
- Text extraction works correctly for image files (with OCR)
- Strategy pattern allows easy addition of new file types
- Extraction errors are properly logged and reported
- Extracted text includes basic structure/formatting information

## Dependencies

- Ticket 1.2: API Design & Health Checks

## Notes

- Consider using a factory pattern for instantiating the appropriate extraction strategy
- Return structured metadata along with extracted text (e.g., page numbers, confidence scores for OCR)
- Set up proper error messages for users when extraction fails
