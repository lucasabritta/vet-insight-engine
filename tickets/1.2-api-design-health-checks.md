# Ticket 1.2: API Design & Health Checks

**Phase:** 1 - Foundation & Infrastructure

**Description:**
Design and implement the initial API endpoints with OpenAPI documentation and basic document management functionality.

## Requirements

- [ ] Define the OpenAPI schema for all endpoints
- [ ] Implement POST /documents/upload endpoint for file uploads
- [ ] Implement GET /documents/{id} endpoint to retrieve document information
- [ ] Implement local file storage for uploaded binaries
- [ ] Add health check endpoints (GET /health)
- [ ] Generate OpenAPI documentation (Swagger UI)
- [ ] Write unit tests for all API endpoints
- [ ] Test file upload and retrieval functionality, use the samples located at data\samples
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases

## Acceptance Criteria

- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation is accessible and complete
- POST /documents/upload successfully stores files and returns a document ID
- GET /documents/{id} returns metadata and references for stored files
- Files are stored reliably on the local filesystem
- API documentation is clear and testable via Swagger UI
- Health check endpoint returns 200 status with service status

## Dependencies

- Ticket 1.1: Project Scaffolding (Dockerized)

## Notes

- Use FastAPI's built-in OpenAPI support for automatic documentation
- Store upload metadata (filename, upload date, content type) alongside the file
- Consider implementing file validation and size limits
