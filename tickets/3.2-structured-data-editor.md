- [ ] Display edit history or change tracking
- [ ] Implement form auto-save or draft saving capabilities
- [ ] Write unit tests for form components
- [ ] Test form validation logic

## Acceptance Criteria

- Form populates correctly with extracted data from the API
- All schema fields are editable and validated
- Changes are saved successfully via the API
- Users receive clear feedback on save success/failure
- Form is intuitive and follows veterinary industry conventions
- Data validation provides helpful error messages

## Dependencies

- Implement responsive design for various screen sizes
- Add undo/redo functionality if feasible
